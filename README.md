FreeTube Cordova is an open source YouTube player built with privacy in mind. Use YouTube without advertisements and prevent Google from tracking you with their cookies and JavaScript.
Available for Android and as a PWA. FreeTube Cordova is a fork of [FreeTube](https://www.github.com/FreeTubeApp).
FreeTube Cordova is currently in Beta. While it should work well for most users, there are still bugs and missing features that need to be addressed.

## How does it work?
FreeTube Cordova uses the [Invidious API](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) to serve data and videos. No official YouTube APIs are used to obtain data. Your subscriptions and history are stored locally on your device and are never sent out.

## Features
* Watch videos without ads
* Use YouTube without Google tracking you using cookies and JavaScript
* Subscribe to channels without an account
* Connect to an externally setup proxy such as Tor
* View and search your local subscriptions, history, and saved videos
* Organize your subscriptions into "Profiles" to create a more focused feed
* Export & import subscriptions
* Youtube Trending
* Youtube Chapters
* Most popular videos page based on the set Invidious instance
* SponsorBlock 
* Full Theme support
* Multiple windows
* Mini Player (Picture-in-Picture)
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Option to show only family friendly content
* Show/hide functionality or elements within the app using the distraction free settings

Go to [FreeTube's Documentation](https://docs.freetubeapp.io/) if you'd like to know more about how to operate FreeTube and its features.
